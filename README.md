# Nasa 2020 App Development Challenge
Our team's submission for the 2020 Nasa App Development Challenge

# About the project
The challenge was to recreate a model of the lunar surface of the moon given a file with all of the coordinate, height, and slope data and create a path that leads to a given destination that an astronaut would be able to walk on. With this information we were able to create a 3D model of a portion of the moon in Unity that a player was able to traverse based on a slope limit. We also had to create 10 communication link checkpoints in which an astronaut could check back to Earth during his course to the destination.
